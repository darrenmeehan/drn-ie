This was our first night dive, which is an elective dive as part of our Advanced Open Water course.

We dove at Junk Yard which is an artificial dive site that is really coming to life! There's various man-made objects that have been sunk here to promote life in the area. Some objects seem to be working better at encouraging life to take hold than others. 

We saw two octopuses in this dive! One was hiding in a toilet believe it or not! The other was "walking" along on the sand.

The night dive is quite different to diving during the day as what can be seen relies on visibility AND the light from your torch. I found while I could see less, it brought a focus to what we could see. I'm looking forward to night diving again soon!

During safety stop we were surrounded by bioluminescent plankton every time we moved. I fancied myself as a bit of a wizard, casting spells with waves of my hand. 

Due to the tide being out, we got collected at the pier instead of getting a long tail back to shore from the dive boat which is what we usually do. 

This was our third dive today. What a day!
