This was the second dive as part of our PADI AOW course. Fish ID is an optional dive.
This dive was chosen through a democratic vote. I voted to try the Bounancy dive but got out voted! Sinead and the other participant voted Fish Identification, which I've very happy about!

This was quote a fun dive, with no real skill work required so we could enjoy the dive free of homework. 

I'm writing this log a few weeks after the dive but I remember being ecstatic afterwards, it's a great feeling to be finished a dive, with another coming up later in the day! 

Sinead and I chose five different species of fish that we had to look out for while on the dive.
Our instructor highlighted differences between fish species and showed us some hand signals to help communicate when we spot the various fish under the water. 

We planned to look for the following fish

- Red breastest Wrase
