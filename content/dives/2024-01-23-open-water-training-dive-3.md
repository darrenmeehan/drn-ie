A photographer from Sairee Cottage came along with us on this dive. I’ve attached the amazing photos he took. He’s an extremely skilled driver, diving on his own which is known as “Self-reliant” diver and so does not need a dive buddy. He has spares for all required equipment and so is his own buddy! I learnt from talking to him that a dive buddy would find it difficult to stay out of the shots.
