This was our first dive on a liveaboard, with 4 dives planned for the day! 

We had dove 3 times yesterday and were traveling to the boat today. 

I've no photos or videos as we just wanted to enjoy the dive!

It was a nice easy dive, with just a light current that we avoided by staying close to the bottom. I found my breathing could have been better. 
BCD was too tight on chest. Need to losen next time.
Wights were 0.8kg in size so needed to do more math.. Dive master thought I was OK with 5.6kg but I'd prefer to have closer to 7kg. Decent was fine but I did feel light.
