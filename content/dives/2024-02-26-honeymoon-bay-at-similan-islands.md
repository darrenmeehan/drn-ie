Was our first dive on a liveaboard, with 4 dives planned for the day! 



We had dove 3 times yesterday and were traveling to the boat today. 

I've no photos or videos as we just wanted to enjoy the dive!



It was a nice easy dive, with just a light current that we avoided by staying close to the bottom.
