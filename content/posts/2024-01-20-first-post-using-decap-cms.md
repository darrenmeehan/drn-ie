Decap is a CMS that allows me to continue with static site generators, while having an easier means of writing and editing. Especially when on the move.

I’ve moved this site from Cloudflare Pages to Netlify. DNS is still managed by Cloudflare, but I needed to move to Netlify to use their Identity product. In time I may move to something self hosted for identity, as with all things it’s dependent on my free time.

I’m writing this post while traveling on a catamaran to Koh Tao in the gulf of Thailand. We’re on the earliest time available today. The waters are calmer in the morning it seems.
