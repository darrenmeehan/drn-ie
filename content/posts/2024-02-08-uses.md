This page documents gadgets, software, tools, and anything else I use that I think is worth sharing. I'll likely go into more detail on some aspects but I'm taking inspiration from other exams of "/uses" pages.

Subscriptions

Spotify Family - I use this regularly for music and podcasts. I'd like to move to something more open for podcasts 

Google One This is something I also share with family. 
The default storage of 15GB isn't enough, we're currently uding 670GB out of 2 TB. 

Proton
I mainly use Proton Mail. Though they offer a VPN service that is useful from time to time. They also have a password manager, though I don't use it as I'm happy with Bitwarden and can justify the extra cost. 

I use Blacknight.com as my registrar for the various domains I own. 
They're an Irish owned company, and provide great quality services. 

Revolut
Easy to use mobile bank. Very useful for sending money to friends, and for currency conversions.


Car
CarSkoda
 Octavia 
A 1 litre petrol, spotline model. Very comfortable to drive and decent economy. 
Android Auto is excellent. The boot gets filled up on many a fun trip!
